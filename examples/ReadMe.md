# Examples

## [Talking to an Arduino from Python](./arduino/)
A simple example showing how to communicate with an Arduino from a Python script running on a PC. It demonstrates a very simple protocol, and how to use the protocol to talk to an Arduino over a serial port.

## [TCP Chat](./chat/)
A TCP chat application demonstrating the ctiny (C) and cpptiny (C++) runtimes. Both implementations use the same protocol definition and can interoperate. Shows CMake integration for automatic code generation.
